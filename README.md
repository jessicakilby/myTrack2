### Subcategory View
Break down your main categories into areas of interest. For example for Home you could have subcategories of heat and air or water filtration systems.

### Item view
Shows individual reminders of things that are going to be coming up. It also is a repository for past instances of when you needed to do that task. For example an item for your home's heat and air filtration system can have notes about what brand and size filter you used as well as a repository of the last time you completed that task.

## Styling
I used the Darkly Bootswatch theme to add consistency between the pages.

# MyTrack

## Description
Have a hard time remembering those important things that don't come around very often? For example, chimney sweepers or heat and air maintenance? My back-end capstone, MyTrack, was built to help keep you organized. It uses HTML, CSS, AngularJS, C# and .net webAPI.


## How to run
After you clone the files, navigate to the correct directory in your terminal.
Then in your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9898
```
Last, navigate [here](http://localhost:9898) in your browser.
